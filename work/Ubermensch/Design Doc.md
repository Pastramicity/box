## Narrative

You are the 'Ubermensch' (the game doesn't refer to you like that cause it's cringe and this term is more of a parallel with the Nietchzean theme). You live in the Last Empire of Mankind (in the Solipsus universe, but little reference to its lore, this is a self-contained story) ruled by God-Emperor, Odhinn (name subject to change). He is the ruler of all mankind and possesses the cyber-psychic ability to influence the individuals in his Greatest Army. Individuals with more cyber-psychic augmentation may be more influenced and controlled by the God Emperor and are thus more powerful. His Eynerjar, the highest of his guard, are controlled all but directly. Life for mankind is suffocated in the claustrophobic, tangled and ancient, layered (hive) Last City, with buildings stacked on buildings, entire separate floors of different generations of millions of years of mankind. Life outside of the God-Emperor's palace is crushingly totalitarian for all but the highest of the political nobility who squabble and fight and distract the masses.

DEATH TO THE GOD-EMPEROR, shows at the beginning of the game.
You, the player, animate the Ubermensch, who is the last living member of the last tribe out of the grasp of the God-Emperor. This tribes' only goal was to develop in secret to one day give birth to the man who would have to go and reclaim humanity for the good. Your tribe died as a result of a long line of solitary people in the village who were planted there by the God-Emperor, who across generations and generations kept the secret of their eventual betrayal. Finally, one day, they made their strike as the tribe had voted for their saviour. The mole killed everyone in the village, but of course the Ubermensch lived and killed the mole for their great betrayal. And with no future left for the tribe, the Ubermensch went to fulfill his task and kill the God-Emperor. He gets into the city, traveling to its center, and approaches the entrance to the palace. The game starts around here.
