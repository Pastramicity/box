# Ubermensch Design Doc

- This game will be an arena shooter. It's goal is to as reasonably fast paced and high APM as possible, as to create the most invigorating, action packed, and fun game I can in a short time.
- It will have resource management
- It will be difficult
- Any sticking to one strategy should be punished
- Variety should be encouraged
- Skill-based tactics should be rewarded and sought
- However, it should not be overwhelming, and should be manageable
- The player should feel as if they were soaring, however with care
- The player should feel triumph when overcoming a challenge, and challenge should be presented regularly
- The player should nearly never stop moving while in combat
- The game should emphasize risk vs. reward tactics
