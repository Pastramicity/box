# Gameplay Ideation

- headshots give health
- melee kills give health
- you have a shield, but once its broken you die in one hit
- overdrive meter
	- you can increase the meter in chunks to deal more damage/get a buff. Too much and your shield breaks
- shotgun
- assault rifle
- semi-auto rifle
- half-life style cursor-targeting rocket launcher
- impact grenade launcher
- up-close ability that hooks a chord to enemy and siphons their energy for you
- combo meter
- wallrunning
- shield breaks and sends a shockwave upgrade
- time slow charges overdrive meter
- some way to 'rocket jump'
- gravity gun blast
- i-frames after shield breaks (could be an upgrade)
- skill trees (like different classes) (borderlands)
- different states of abilities (stances)
- mastery
- know your state OBVIOUSLY
- CRAZY MOVEMENT
- STATE SYSTEM (You know the one)
- Semi-auto rifle, that the alt fire splits into two submachine guns and back
- HID style low ammo charge-up tesla coil, alt fire is hacking dart that makes enemy turn against other enemies
- Shotgun, alt fire is close-range, chomps/chops enemy into pieces(ammo)
- Turret with high and low toss (left and right click). If it hits the floor, becomes a turret. If reactivated in the air (with either button) it shoots bullets beneath in a cone. If it hits an enemy, it attaches and does high single target damage.
- At all times you have access to a parry. You can only parry melee attacks, on a successful parry, you go into a phase dimension where nothing can hit you for a short time, and upon exiting, you get a small, separate overshield (and maybe mobility cooldowns are gone)
- Overcharge mobility is a 45 degree angle backwards rocket boost
- Neutral attack is iron man chest repulsor beam
- Neutral mobility is a directional lateral dash on the ground, but a forward 45 degree boost in the air
- Overcharge attack will on the ground shotgun kick in a cone in front of you. In the air it will make you fall and do an explosive axe kick. Both kicks will then launch you backwards to disengage
- Low attack shoots a low damage dart. If the dart hits an enemy, it will stun any enemies touching the line connected between you and the dart and send you to overcharge after a short time
- low mobility is a short directional blink/teleport
- tesla gun  is actually a large ship anchor attached by a chain to the gun, while in the gun it just acts like a directed tesla coil (primary fire), but with the alternative fire it shoots out the chain-attached anchor and it acts like a grappling hook, but it only gets lodged in large enemies, where it electricutes them (small humanoid-size enemies are just one shot, cut in half or something idk), then you can retract the hook, pulling the enemy to you.
