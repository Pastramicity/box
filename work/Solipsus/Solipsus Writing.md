# Solipsus Writing

## Intro Text

Griffith's world was of glistening green emeralds and shining copper architecture. However, as copper, the facade will rust, and leave hollow monuments coated in tarnish.

He led a sect of the Capital's religion dedicated to the linking of man and Shekhin, She who Prospers. Of more ambition, and of more secrets, Griffith hid his actual devotion to the discovery of the Old Gods.

Relishing in the tranquility his studies and wealth provided, his inner meditations stagnated, as he sought those outside himself. In so doing, an Old One sought to bring him the humility he lacked, and brought him to ancient depths.

This God was none other than

- The Being Astral
	- The God of Magic, corrupting those sorcerers who find the truths of primordial creation
- The Festering Wound
	- The God of Pain, spreading the Spinescourge that so mangles and distorts the body
- The One Mind
	- The God of the Machine, turning its subjects into their creations, a mockery of mechanics, and the physics of the world.

He was tainted, and his fall from grace would infect his thoughts. Griffith learned he must seek an inner truth to cure his illness, and his studies taught that he must trek to the end of the world in search of the Great Spire, whose domain was held by one other God, of whom no whisper is uttered by those who wished to live in peace.
