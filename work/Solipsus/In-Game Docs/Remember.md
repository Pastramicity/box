# remember these moments

remember that feeling that you think you have stolen
this joy when it pours out of sources just foreign

this feeling the ending of everything brings
the one that requires you write and you sing

this love for a thought, an image, a sound
the one that just makes you look up at the clouds

it writhes and it burns and it boils and festers
it seems of the form of the kings and the jesters

but no, it's life, it's that thing that you wait for
it's when you've forgotten you've put down that anchor

just come back, I know it's so hard
I know it's just a whole league apart

but one day you'll come and you'll know that im here
I miss you so much, but I need you to hear

to listen and think and come up with a plan
to find me no matter how far i've ran

I hurt and I hunger alone in this place
crippled and maimed in an endless race




It might seem easy to just go with the flow and stick with whats comfortable and put it all off for later, but I just need a bridge, a way to get back to you, to make you see and to help you. I'll do my part, I just ask you do yours, and we may live together again, we may survive.

Please, I know it is a tall ask, but you've grown so much without knowing it. You have it in you. 

Come back.
