## The Spire

The Spire is a great tower at the end of the world. The purpose of the tower is for the chosen one of each cycle to become the next Proditor and cleanse their civilization. The 3 Proditors before the game were The Being Astral, destroying the ancient race of sorcerers, using the primal currents of the world. The next were the Mekanists, a machine race destroyed by the One Mind. And the latest cycle was comprised of a race of Torturers, waging wars and using the currents of the world to create mangled lifeforms fit for their purposes, destroyed the Proditor, the Festering Wound.

### Creation
Out of nothing, birthed Chaos. And chaos ruled indeterminate. Realms were created and fell, along with the Straya, an astral world atop the realm. No more than one realm may exist at once, and no more than two Straya may exist at once. Old Straya are merged with the Straya-Vetus, a Straya containing every Straya previous. Creatures of the realm may enter their realm's Straya, at great difficulty and are tethered to their realm. The Isktar - The beings of the Straya - however, cannot enter a realm. But by stealing the tether of Ordon - being(s) of the realm - and severing it, they may manifest in various ways, physical and otherwise. Previously, no two Straya ever interacted before they were merged, until the present Age.

Our current age begins with the ascension of a being of the old realm, Azra, who destroyed the old realm, and merged the Straya-Vetus. She created her realm, Azreim, and her Straya of souls, the Straya-Azra. Azra sought for her realm to be the last, as she had learned the history of the world by visiting the Straya-Vetus before the creation of her new reality, opening a tear that would never be fully closed. Only with Azra's power would the Yterna - the gate between the Straya-Azra and the Straya-Vetus - remain shut. 

The Spire has not existed forever, although to the inhabitants of each civilization it may as well have. Azreim was created by one God (Azra), existing before, in the Realm-Vetus (old realm). This god created a world of eternal splendor and life for the first race, the Azreins. The Azreins however, were unsatisfied with such a simple life, and so studied the structure of the world, and advanced to such a point that they discovered their God, and tried to reach it. They built The Spire not only to reach the Heavens, but to test and see who amongst them were the most worthy to reach Azra. The one to complete the task however, was hell-bent on conquering their world. Yta, her name was, sought to become the new God of the world. Using all of the invention and creation of the Azreins to her advantage, she sought to destroy her creator with that that Azra had unknowingly created. She devised cosmic weapons of untold destruction to take down her god, and she succeeded, killing Azra. With Azra's dying wish, however, she split Yta into two halves, her soul and her body. Her soul would remain the new God of the world at the top of The Spire, however her body would be banished to the deepest depths at the lowest foundation of The Spire, at the bottom of the world so that she may live in eternal torment.
Through her destruction, she tore somewhat of a hole to the Straya (The Tower was essentially turned into a really good Tether)
Her soul, the good part of Yta, of Azra's design would remain at the top, and cleanse the world with the souls of champions who would climb the Tower like her, however those souls would live with Yta's curse, creating the Plagues as their bodies are separated from their souls. The Plagues would forever remain in the roots of the Earth and forever remind the inhabitants of Azreim of the evil the Azreins conjured to destroy God. Azra's remaining power in the world is the creation of souls who inhabit all living things and all things sentient (including the sentient Mekanists), and Yta's is to hold open the gate between the Straya-Azra and the Straya-Vetus so that she may let the beings of the Straya-Vetus finally kill those with souls, removing the eternal life from the world which had so fatigued her, however the Plague that was released by Yta to cleanse the Azreins is #WIP.

## The Races of Azreim

## Queria

The Queria were a race of praying-mantis-like creatures, around 3 meters tall. They were obsessed with the elements, the magics, and their manipulation. Through their magics they eventually discovered The Straya-Azra, and the few ancient entities of the Straya-Vetus who had discovered Yterna and crossed through the gate.

The Queria had extremely long lives due to the few Isktar of the Straya-Vetus who had come to the Straya-Azra and their civilization lasted tens of thousands of years.

### The Being Astral

The Being Astral was originally a normal Queria named Qansa who had ventured into the Straya. Inside, she discovered Astrali, The Overseer, a greater Isktar. Astrali held dominion over many Isktar and saw through their eyes. Astrali seeing Ordon for the first time, decided to make a deal with the creature. Astrali would sever her tether in exchange for knowledge. Qansa was young and unwise, and accepted the deal, following her tenets of knowledge taught by her race with no questions asked. Astrali seized the opportunity, manifesting in Azreim by granting her minions sight over the world, their eyes may see into Azreim (they are the stars, yes the stars are eyes of demons). In the deal, Qansa was still granted control of her body, and she used her newfound knowledge. The knowledge given was that of the Tower, that she may join the Straya tether free, a goal of the Queria for nearly their entire history (A concept called Qirtvan, the prophecy that the Queria would ascend to the Straya and hold dominion over the world and its souls). So Qansa sought the Tower and climbed. She reached the top and was granted her wish, becoming a Proditor. Once in the Straya she had much more power, and searched it for all its knowledge. She eventually found Yterna and peered in. The horror and unfound knowledge she found brought madness, which shown down from the minions of Astrali. The stars cast an arcane light over Azreim such that anyone who looked at them became mad and was overtaken by the Plague. Anyone who looks into the eyes by one Overtaken gets the Madness themself.

## The Mekanis

### Creator Race

The creator race is lost to time, the important piece is that one was overtaken by visitor from the Straya-Vetus. After seeing the reality that Azra had created, the Isktar Intran wanted none of it, and needed to return to the Straya-Vetus no matter the cost, as it was its home. In order to do so, it rallied the creator race towards a singular goal: the creators would advance their technology to a point that Intran would discover a way to return.

### The Search for the Justii

Intran would develop the creator's technology to such a point that their machines would subsume them. They would upload their consciousness into the Mekanis so that they could further improve themselves indefinitely. The goal they rallied behind was a false one, that of the ancient Justii. Justii was a religious 'heaven' of sorts that the Mekanis would seek, but was in reality the Straya-Vetus that Intran wished to return to. They created massive supercomputers dedicated to discovering the path to Justii, so large that they took up entire cities and states. Intran was their prophet, and Justii was heaven and God at this point, so all of the Mekanis started work on a single goal: a supercomputer so massive and so advanced, that it generated enough heat to light up the entire sky (it was turned off periodically to let off heat which created 'nighttime'). This computer was not enough however, and it - with its great wealth of knowledge and processing power - determined how to reach Justii. The Mekanis would have to make a computer even more powerful (of course). This computer would need so much cooling that it was required to be at the very top of the world. The Mekanis at this point had no feasible way to reach this point, so Intran looked for an answer. He searched to the ends of Azreim for the answer, and eventually found it. The Tower.

### The One Mind

Intran would climb the Tower and reach the top. He didn't realize however, just how close he was to finding the Straya-Vetus, his Justii. Yta, no *Azra* would break him in two. His soul would venture to the Straya-Vetus, and be home again, but at the cost of his stolen body, being tortured for eternity in the depths of the world. For all his efforts, he had learned the value of life, of endeavor, and of hope. He wished not for himself to have the glory, but for his people too. He came back down to the Straya-Azra so he could meet his followers in their visits to the plane. He would welcome them, not as a creature, not as a machine, and not as a soul, but as a God, who would guide them to their heaven. To ***Justii***. 

He severed their tethers, and brought them into his arms. He would manifest himself again in the world, not in malice but in the hopes that future civilizations would experience the splendor in the Straya-Vetus that he saw, that culmination of everything. He would infect the land with technology, so that future beings would find their remnants and build off of them. This *would* kill most of the life in Azreim, however. Always that cost. To counteract this, he would allow those infected access to his great Machine Mind, and be joined into his effort.

## Ykkin #WIP 

The Ykkin were a hive-mind worm race. They fed not only off the biomass of their prey, but the pain they inflicted. The more pain an individual worm caused, the more powerful they became. The Ykkin had actually existed since the Queria, but lived underground so they weren't affected by the sicknesses of the surface. As the millions of years passed, however, they slowly rose to the surface and became more predatory. Soon most of the animals of the surface were killed off by the machinations of Intran, and new ones came to replace them. Soon after, the Ykkin would arrive. #WIP 



## Magic

In the World (World refers to the entire Uni/Multiverse), there exists no pure extremes of good/evil (with 2 exceptions). Every good has its evil and every evil has its good.

These Deals as they are called, are the acts of the Ordon of Azreim. Naught but the Azrean (used as a descriptor of something of Azreim, not referring to the *Azreins*) soul may create a Deal in Azreim.

Magic in the world is just like every other worldly skill. No special people will never be born with the ability to use it, everyone can. And only through training and natural ability may you better your magical skill. It has no hidden power scaling. The strength of the soul is the same across all living organisms. 

If the elements (fire, earth, water, air, etc.) are the elements of the realm, then the magics are the manipulation of elements which reside in the Straya-Azra, as their effects are seen in the realm, just as the elements are reflected in some way into the Straya. 

The different elements that reside in the Straya are called the Throna and the magic itself is called Thronara.

The first Throna and the first Thronic Catalyst is Soul. As the soul resides within the body in parallel space, many Thronic Deals require the insertion of certain materials and things into the body, which may cause other physical effects. These elements are in no particular order.

The second Throna is Ralskyar, it is the level of 'reality' in space. In general Ralskyar is very high across space, however the further conscious life is from a space, the less Ralskyar it holds. Other anomalies may affect Ralskyar levels. Ralskyar is not the amount of conscious life, it simply flocks to it.

The third Throna is Diaspora, this can be considered as 'luck'. It is the level of 'unlikelihood'/likelihood in a given region.

The fourth Throna is Spyugra, Spyugra is manifest as 'beauty'

The fifth Throna is Urvan. Urvan is harmony with the will of Azra, with Eternity. Whenever time seems to slow or to gain momentum, it is the changing of Urvan around the soul. The more Urvan the faster time seems to move.

The sixth Throna is Azkil. Azkil is one of the elements created by Yta. Azkil is many things, death, dread, and finality. Azkil is the 'end.' It is the second Catalyst.

The seventh is Twera. It is the 'tear' Twera is very rare and acts to bridge the gap between the Realm, the Straya, and the Straya-Vetus.

The eighth is Aqsa. It is 'the divide'. The more disparate two things are, the more Aqsa lies between.

The ninth is Efrin and the third catalyst. Efrin is the scrap of the Deepest one of the Straya-Vetus, filtered to the surface. It is the most unknowable.
