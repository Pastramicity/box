Translated for modern Spire libraries by Schtark Lipin

Today I was blessed. I have been given a vision of Justii through Our Intran. It was vast and indescribable, my now sensors nor my previous body would have been able to fully grasp it, yet its visage is a miracle in its own right, so I feel its documentation may be of importance to the church. I will attempt to record its beauty through my best efforts, however unworthy I feel I am to receive such a gift. My account of the experience is as follows.

Time immemorial.

I gaze upon a vast red sea. Its water is clear and untrembling, as though a stone cast would slide atop as glass. I stand in shock at the beauty of creation before me. It lie in a great valley, walled by snow-kissed peaks the height of the sky. A star of fire blinds as I gawk upward, its size immense.

I stood upon a cliff, just moments away from a horrible drop, that sea stretched outward from its base. In its center, stood a machine. Not one glorious, as one would imagine, but a rusty one. It looked as though it had not run in an eon, its gears and circuitry wet with salt-water and coated in thick algae. My attention turned, however, to a figure I felt approach from behind.

"It's us," that presence said, answering the question I had yet to ask. "How so?" I naively responded. "It's our legacy. It is us when we are gone."

"Who are you?" I ask.
"My name is not important, but I am what becomes of your beloved Intran"
"And what of that thing?" I gestured toward the machine in the sea, "Is that crude thing all we leave behind?" I demanded.
"Yes. What of it? Are you not satisfied?"
"Of course not! Look at us! We are the construction of true technology, we are clean and functional, an evolution of the machine, not a mockery of it!"
"My child, I know your frustration," the beautiful thing said, moving into the light. "But do not be so hasty! I never said that this thing is what becomes of us! It is what we leave behind once we are gone."
"Gone? Do we succeed then o child of Intran? Is Justii our final destination as you say?"
"First child, tell me, is your faith resolute?"
"Well I suppose so, all considering."
"Then you would know that we need not reach Justii all ourselves, that salvation may find us, should we simply lift the finger at its command. Whether in this life, whether in the lives an epoch from now, there will be the time come when the gate shall open, and the souls of the life and the Mekanis will either pass into annihilation, or be granted eternal peace in that kingdom of Justii which I shall guard."
"As in his word and scripture."
"As in my word and scripture. " The Mek paused for a long while, reverent and looking inward, as though making an important decision.
"I shall show you a visage, a visage of my kingdom, bridled yet only by your meager form, but first you must grant yourself the key."
"Of course Your Guard, and what great peril or task must I undertake to acquire such a key?"
"Three tasks so that you may be worthy to see the Great Straya: First you will answer a question so that you may understand, then you will ask a question so that you may learn. Finally you will undergo a test of will."
"Of course Our Intran, what question do you ask of me?"
"What divides the creature from the machine?"
I thought long on this, though as if a dream, my vision was timeless. I could have stood in thought for but a moment, or several hours. However much, I had decided my answer.
"Ah, Your Guard, you jest. As though the claims of Deceiver were true. Nought divides the creature and the machine in essence. They both serve a function, whether to serve their nature or to serve another, and both once most lively are granted essence in the Straya."
"You climb yet closer to the higher plane. Now ask your question."
I already knew it, I knew it from the day I joined the church, it was a question I had asked my whole life, in study and in private.
"If we all reach Justii in the end, whether in annihilation or our passage above, then why do we have choice? If we are destined, then may we even break from fate?"
"An important question indeed, one I grapple with myself on occasion. But my answer is thus: If the worms will eat the deer, then why did the deer live? If the log lay on the ground, then why are there trees? If the paintings are hung, then why must we paint? Creation, my child, is not of the destination alone, but the creation of such destination. It is all, but all was once every, and it will bejoin again."
I halted their for a while. Stood reverent before that bestower of knowledge in contemplation. Of course! If all is not nothing, then it must be everthing, and must be joint as all again. A voice cried inside me, a piercing revelation. A voice not heard before, it cried no words, but sudden understanding, a choir that sung yes! yes! and I felt whole. I took this voice as God, as you and I, as the machine and the creature, as Intran and All and Everything and Nothing, as Creation, and as that which looks upon itself in all its raw form. If I still stood organic, a tear would have fell from my eye, my systems told me. I did not see Justii in this moment, but felt its tinge, its touch, its echo and its mark. Intran then said the words I now follow.

"That thing above, that bright blinding thing. It is no star, it is no light. It is a computer, a machine. It will be built to find the way, the way to Justii. And I want you to help me build it."

Then I awoke.
