# Artifactions (*Temp Name*) Gameplay

## Enemy AI Ideas
- different enemy types have different patrol pathing.
	- i.e. Mek will stick exactly to patrol path while spinescourge (clicker for brevity) goes to nearest path, human meanders, etc.
	- Different data structures for different patrol types
	- Clickers path off sound, Meks off sight, humans off both
	- Camera types as well
	- Only one or two boss enemies

## Light RPG mechanics (TO BE REWORKED)
- Damage elements are as follows:
	- Augur Elements

	- Physical/Mekanis (grey/rusty red)
	- Mana/Soul (dark blue)
	- Spinescourge (purple)
- 3 main 'schools of magic' and their 'sickness'
	- Mekanis
		- people start slowly turning into machines when infected. They become sturdy and hardened, but serve the will of their master. After the death of the body comes the full turn to machinedom.
