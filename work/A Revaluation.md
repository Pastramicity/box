# A Revaluation

## On Superstition

1. Hark! Hark you bound ones! I call to you! I bid you, use those spotlights. Cast away these shadow-devils with their honeyed words. They speak, unredeemed by the world. Their reason is trickery, and their argument, a magician's illusion.
2. Avoid these apparitions. Find your disdain, I say! And use it to orient away from these sweet lies, lest they send you down dark roads.
3. Nay! Nay! Three times nay! That is what I say to those hinterworlds. Love the Earth, and all that is well-known by its evidence. A precarious leap to hidden ledges is what I call those hidden realms.
4. Faith? Bah! It is twisted by old guessings and leapings. Let us redefine faith. It is love, I decree, love of that which gives and fills the life. Faith now? Eureka! It is love of fate and that birthing womb known as Earth and Body and Self.
5. Only repeat what has its reason. Not but one reason, though. Why not a multitude! And may the be re-examined ad infinitum. And discriminate not against that reason too simple, or that reason too lengthy. Vetting cares not of complexity nor length.

## On Direction

1. Praise! Praise, one should give. But disdain and contempt too! What is disdain and contempt, I hear? Why, it is a steering away from bramble-woods. Praise? That too, a steering towards and an ever seeking up fruity mountain trails.
2. Oh, oh! A great agony! A great anguish and siren song from every valley of humankind. It says pity! It weeps for those trodden, lowly, clawing ones. You there! Let them tear you not asunder.
3. Of my higher hopes and deepest places, may you riot and revolt! May you vomit at pity and overthrow it, that god-emperor of humankind. Instead, may it be fuel for a fire that will turn it to ash!
4. What is the spark? The spark is an extending hand that pulls such cliff-hangers from doom and pity-begetting to willow-shades. What is the fire this spark induces? A holding hand, that two may climb the highest heights.
5. I foresee two worlds: There is a quiet, sad dying one. She is hedon and warm and unrisking; She is the underground and may imagine no more words of wisdom. He is the last, the final, and the most despicable human. But the other! Oh! Oh the other! She is a lion! She is the ever-climbing humankind. He is the roar and blinding light of a thousand suns! And at the end of time, He will go out in supernova. May it rupture! May the greatest world of tomorrow splay out its awe and sublimity and love upon the cosmos!
6. But, I hear you say, "I see no mountains, and I see no cliffs, for there is a great haze! And  I know not what lies at the tops of these hills that I do see!" To you I say, destroy these hills with violent, fiery fury. Only the tallest mountains do not hold cliffs, nor do they crumble. Then, climb those tallest peaks with measured, striding steps!
