# Artifactions Lore



## Cycle of the World

The realm/world, named Azreim (WIP) runs in cycles. A great civilization will rise, and a chosen one from each civilization will go to [[#The Spire]] To cure one of the Great Plagues that afflicts them. Many come to The Spire to cure their affliction and each cycle, all but one will fail. Once inside the spire, you cannot truly die, being stuck in the spire until the end of time if you cannot reach the summit. Those who reach the summit will have their affliction cured but at a great cost. They must become a Proditor, a god of the world, a cause of a new Great Plague. These new plagues wipe out the civilizations of the Proditor's kin and make way for a new world atop it. Azreim is in its 4th cycle at the start of the game.

## The Spire

The Spire is a great tower at the end of the world. The purpose of the tower is for the chosen one of each cycle to become the next Proditor and cleanse their civilization. The 3 Proditors before the game were The Being Astral, destroying the ancient race of sorcerers, using the primal currents of the world. The next were the Mekanists, using those primal currents to fuel their machines, destroyed by the One Mind. And the latest cycle was comprised of a race of Torturers, waging wars and using the currents of the world to create mangled lifeforms fit for their purposes, destroyed the the Proditor, the Festering Wound.

### Creation

The Spire has not existed forever, although to the inhabitants of each civilization it may as well have. Azreim was created by one God (Azra), existing before time. This god created a world of eternal splendor and life for the first race, the Azreins. The Azreins however, were unsatisfied with such a simple life, and so studied the structure of the world, and advanced to such a point that they discovered their God, and tried to reach it. They built The Spire not only to reach the Heavens, but to test and see who amongst them were the most worthy to reach Azra. The one to complete the task however, was hell-bent on conquering their world. Yta, her name was, sought to become the new God of the world. Using all of the invention and creation of the Azreins to her advantage, she sought to destroy her creator with that that Azra had unknowingly created. She devised cosmic weapons of untold destruction to take down her god, and she succeeded, killing Azra. With Azra's dying wish, however, she split Yta into two halves, her soul and her body. Her soul would remain the new God of the world at the top of The Spire, however her body would be banished to the deepest depths at the lowest foundation of The Spire, at the bottom of the world so that she may live in eternal torment.
Her soul, the good part of Yta, of Azra's design would remain at the top, and cleanse the world with the souls of champions who would climb the Tower like her, however those souls would live with Yta's curse, creating the Plagues as their bodies are separated from their souls. The Plagues would forever remain in the roots of the Earth and forever remind the inhabitants of Azreim of the evil the Azreins conjured to destroy God. Azra's remaining power in the world is the creation of souls, and Yta's is the fate of death for those outside the Spire.
