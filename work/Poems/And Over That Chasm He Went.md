# And Over That Chasm He Went

And he felt that bead of sweat trickle down his forehead as rapture on his skin,
And it was not so hot, but the hike had been tiresome.
He felt it in his legs, their little wobbles,
But he straightened them, as he stopped for a moment.

He was looking forward, but not quite seeing,
And so he now realized that he neared the peak he climbed toward.
And above that peak the sky gave way,
To a cloud so bright it almost stung

He pulled his canteen from out his pouch, and felt his sword secure.
That drink was icy cold
And further he awoke, and more and more
As he pushed toward the sky


And Oh! His tears o'ertook him,
Before now lay a gap of snowy mist.
So far below one could fall forever.
Sublime... and it was eternity.

But not so quick! For up he looked,
As so he often did,
Above that field atop a spire
Lay the highest castle 

And now as courage filled his lungs,
And fatigue left his legs,
He began that descent beneath that veil
And over that chasm he went!
