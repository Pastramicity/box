# Rap Lyrics 1

Ishaan's lyrics so corny.
Buckling like some whore knee.
Rizzing them up like poetry.
These hoes all over me.

This bitch got thick thighs.
But fuck this girl's mania
Living high in the high rise
I'ma grab my piece and I'ma brain ya

Spittin on bars? More like spittin on dick.
Flyin to mars in my brand new lick.
Call 'em a mohel, suckin off that blood.
Yeah, there's blood in the soil and blood in the mud.

Fuck the government, fuck the establishment too
Did you really ever think they ever cared about you?
I'll I'm gonna say is that I'm feelin kinda mischievous
Might just cause some havoc, while im while I'm missin all the mistresses
