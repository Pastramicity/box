Crystal asks Ivan which of these three animals are most closely related, and why, according to this class.Marco asks Ashley which animals are most closely related out of these three (rat, frog, bird), and how she can explain it.According to the diagram, what trait is shared by BOTH frogs and birds?Trisha asks Monique the explain the difference between the terms OBSERVATION and INTERPRETATION, using this diagram for examples.The following image shows three copies of the same diagram. In each example, a red outline selects a different set of animals. If two animals share a common ancestor, they probably look alike.  Animals that have the same ecology (habitat, abilities, etc.) are probably closely related.  A CLADE is a group of animals that includes a last common ancestor, and ALL of its descendants.  Scientists cannot create cladograms unless they know ALL the descendents of any given animal. Corneous Beta-Proteins are taught, springy mollecular structures that allow the biological construction of tough, delicate structures, like feathers.
