## Included Bars

Yeah its D-Day throw the D-boys to their doom,
Bend your reality, I'm at 800 Hume,
How thick did you say the walls were in my room?
Over the foundation I sit, and I loom

I chill out, pop a couple of 500
Across the world I roam, you know they have me hunted
I take a look at you and now your brain is stunted
The biggest scips in the nation I confronted

## Potential Bars

You know me and the scips drop the hardest bars
We're gonna rock your world from Earth, Jupiter and Mars
I know you're antsy so I'll keep it terse
You're gonna need amnestics for this next verse

Dr. Bright, shine a light, Ima fight
The Serpent's Hand can't even match my might
Oh, you're approaching me, you know I'm at my height
I scare the creatures that go bump in the night
