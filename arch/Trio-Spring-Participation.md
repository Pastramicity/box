# TRIO Student Support Services Participation Scholarship Response

## (Chase Yates)

In my path through university so far, I have encountered a great deal of difficulty in acquiring financial aid, having to resort to large percentages of my tuition being supported by student loans, which were not easy to acquire, given I have little in the way of family able to support my endeavors financially.

Being an 'out of state' student also means that my barrier to entry is significantly higher, and the funds provided by federal loans, grants like the Pell Grant, etc. do not nearly cover the cost of housing and tuition. In spite of this I have thankfully managed to work my way into the University of Utah and into the TRIO program. This scholarship will be able to better support my path going forward, and hopefully continue to do so during the rest of my time at the university. This scholarship will allow me more opportunities to support my education financially, and it will allow me to further spread my wings during my college experience.

I am currently shooting for a BS in Computer Science with an emphasis on Entertainment, Arts, and Engineering (EAE). I am hoping this will provide me with the tools, knowledge, and experience necessary to pursue a career in programming, specifically in designing video games. I am also interested in other related fields, such as cybersecurity, application software development, and cryptography. As for a minor, I am still deciding, however I am currently leaning in the direction of business as that will teach me the necessary steps in entrepreneurship so that I may secure my own business at some point in the near future.

In order to secure this route I have pursued further education in university, of course, but also in my own free time, dedicating many of my hobbies to practicing what may end up being my career one day. I make games in my spare time, practice cybersecurity, and develop small apps. I pursue knowledge in reading and online to better myself and to ensure my success.

I hope these opportunities in the TRIO and SSS programs will afford me the tools necessary to brighten my future and provide for my education during this semester and going forward.
