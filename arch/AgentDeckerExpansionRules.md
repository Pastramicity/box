# Agent Decker: Robot Madness

Agent Decker: Robot Madness is an expansion for Agent Decker created by Chase Yates

## Parts

- All components needed to play the base game of Agent Decker
- This instruction manual
- 20 Expansion cards. There should be an included printable pdf. This pdf has cards with large red Xs, these cards are not in the expansion. All marked cards without Xs, with the Ex marker on the bottom are expansion cards. The cards on the first page that look like the traditional Agent Decker initial starting cards, but with the 'Ex' mark should be included with the original Agent Decker initial starting cards.

## Rules

To start playing, assemble agent Decker how you normally would, with the expansion cards included, and remove the 'Bin' cards from the base game. Expansion cards are marked with an 'Ex' on the bottom.

Play is mostly as normal, simply read and follow what each new card says.
There are obstacle cards with a new type: the Robot type. These work how you would expect, just like people cards, animal cards, location cards, etc. Certain cards may interact specifically with robot cards, so keep this in mind.

You may see a symbol that is a rectangle with a triangle cut out of the top on certain cards. These are 'special abilities' and can only be activated by specific cards which say so. If you cannot activate these cards, ignore the rule stated after the symbol, and use the card without that rule. If a card has this symbol, then you need a minimum of one activator card to use the ability/rule. Some activatible cards make use of multiple activators, so keep this in mind.

There are multiple side missions added in the expansion. Simply interact with these cards as they instruct.

That should be it! Now you're ready to play Agent Decker: Robot Madness!
