# Strange Fruit Dialogue

- Me (M), Friend (F)

F: "What was that all about?"
M: "The song is called *Strange Fruit*, I believe its about lynching of blacks in the South."
F: "So, what *is* the Strange Fruit in the song?"
M: "The strange fruit is the bodies of lynched blacks in the South."
F: "Did Holliday write the song?"
M: "No, a Jewish American man named Abel Meeropol."
F: "Why would he write such a song?"
M: "I think he believes that lynching is a topic we don't talk enough about in our society, and its lack of prosecution is a large issue we need to talk about."
F: "I'm not very familiar with lynching, could you tell me about it?"
M: "Yeah, lynching has been a problem since the 1890s and even before. Since black folks started getting more socioeconomically successful, racist whites wanted some sort of retribution. They hang black people and brutalize them in broad daylight and people cheer for it."
F: "Wow, that's disgusting, thanks for informing me. I imagine she'll get extreme pushback from this."
M: "For sure, she is taking a big risk singing this, I don't imagine the government nor other club owners will want her to sing this."
F: "What do you think the 'blood on the leaves and blood on the root' line means?"
M: "I think it means that racism is not just a problem that we can easily solve, but that racism is institutional and ingrained in our government and society."
