I wanted to create a game that took elements from my favorite games and placed them in a new context, surrounded by dice, one of the most fundamental elements in common board games. I took elements from Slay the Spire, one of my favorite video games, and elements from Dungeons & Dragons, though I have never played it. The first idea that sprouted was that the board of a game like life could be folded into a D6 with ease, and subsequently, rolling this die would constitute for interesting gameplay, involving a certain amount of luck. Then, I wanted to introduce a combat system to complement the fairly traditional and worn out gameplay of moving a character across a board. Thus, I made a 5x5 grid that would utilize obstacles to create arenas for combat, then I figured interaction with not only the enemies, but that these obstacles, may be interacted with.

I used a similar card and energy system to slay the spire, introducing complex dice rolls, not only to balance abilities, but to add that random element D&D has. Your character has stats to simulate this as well, and to allow for more variety with event cards, as well as more complex rewards when it comes to defeating enemies.
