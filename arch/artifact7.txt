# A Short Review of Hollow Knight

Hollow Knight is a $15 metroidvania game available on all platforms. This is my favorite video game ever, so I may be very biased. I played it during a time in my life in which I wasn't doing so hot and this game really stuck with me and lifted me up, however temporarily, so I feel a deep attachment to it.

The game can run anywhere from 30 to upwards of 60 hours long depending on how deeply you explore the map and find secrets/do challenges. Not to mention the game has a fair bit of replayability, with different pathways to explore and challenge modes to run after your first main playthrough.

From a purely monetary perspective, Hollow Knight is a steal, getting you around 4 hours per dollar of quality content if you go looking for it.

Hollow Knight has 4 main pillars to its gameplay loop:

- Exploration
- Enemy Fighting
- Platforming
- Boss Fighting

These gameplay loops are present throughout, mixed and matched, and tested, especially at the end in which a large end-game challenge is given to the player regarding each pillar.

- Exploration: Grub hunt
- Enemy Fighting: Last colloseum challenge
- Platforming: White Palace (and Path of Pain for an even harder challenge in it)
- Boss Fighting: Godhome boss rushes

The main compliment I have for Hollow Knight is that it just keeps going. Like Elden Ring after it, you'll think you're near the bottom or end of the map, then you find a tram or a hole, and fall through to reveal the world is twice as big as you previously thought. Some areas are certainly less fleshed out than others, but no area is flat-out bad. It is quality throughout and the quantity is there to keep you coming back for a while.
