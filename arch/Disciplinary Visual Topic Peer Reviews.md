Overall I think you have a good start. Try to remember that this is an argumentative project, you should be trying to make a clear claim by the end. Remember that your audience likely doesn't know too much about video games. Try to add more credibility to your argument by skipping on the criticism; focus on the analysis and how it translates across game genres. Also try to make it clear whether you are focusing on video game covers/box art vs advertisements. As for your presentation, you don't need much as most of the content is covered by the script, but try to give it a style so it's a bit nicer to look at, and stick with a consistent alignment, I went with center as my project was very similar.

Your video was very detailed and informative. It definitely stated a clear claim at the start, supported it throughout, then finished off with a nice conclusion. I'm not sure if the video format you chose is what we need to do, but nonetheless it suits the script well. Remember that this is an argumentative assignment, and while opinions on the games you talk about may add context, I'm not sure how much it adds to your claim. This is a minor nitpick, though. With video games, try and remember that your audience might not be so familiar with them, and certain turns of phrase might not be understood. This is an annoying thing to deal with for sure though, especially with the lower required word count, so take this advice as you will. You have a great start all in all!
