In this exhibit, you will see the history of Louis Armstrong's life, his impact on jazz, and his legacy lasting until today and beyond. You may listen to some of his hit records like 'What a Wonderful World', 'Heebie Jeebies', 'West End Blues', you may listen to his recordings with various groups like the Hot Five, Fletcher Henderson's Orchestra, or his recordings with King Oliver, another famous figure in jazz.

This exhibit will serve to memorialize Louis Armstrong, but his work and life as well. Featured in this exhibit is a large picture of Armstrong as guests make their way to the end of the hall to connect a face to the name they see studying his life through the images and objects we have procured. The brick walls and im lighting of the hall serves not only to simulate the New Orleans, Chicago, New York City, and Harlem jazz clubs and black and tan clubs which pioneered racial integration in the regions, but also to allow the bright lighting present to accentuate the images songs, objects, and others featured in this exhibit.

## Biography

Louis Armstrong was born on August 4, 1901.
Louis Armstrong had a rough early life. His father abandoned the family and had to live with his grandmother for a time. Being African American, Armstrong had to face discrimination, segregation laws, and racism. Starting out his career, Louis Armstrong played music on riverboats in New Orleans, as well as brass bands. He later would get to work with King Oliver and would make a few recordings, as well as influence the scene of jazz to an extent, being a part of one of the most famous jazz groups at the time. To work on his own music and move on from the group, Louis Armstrong left to work on his own music. After this, Armstrong was invited to work with the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra, another chance to influence the scene of jazz. It was here that Armstrong switched to his iconic trumpet. He even influenced some of the other members of the orchestra with his playing, as can be seen in the case of Coleman Hawkins. During this, he also worked with a few notable jazz musicians and singers, one of which being Bessie Smith. After being satisfied with his work in the orchestra, Louis Armstrong moved back to Chicago and would make the 'Louis Armstrong and the Hot Five' group. Armstrong would later turn out to be a fantastic vocalist, being known for his singing and scat. Although often being politically unspoken, Armstrong pushed for civil rights through criticizing Eisenhower's lack of push for the movement, and allowed white Americans of the time to experience a medium heavily influenced by black musicians, and became very popular because of this and his ability with music.

## Songs

It demonstrates his later movement into the vocal range of music. This piece would be played through small exhibits with headphones for listeners
- The second song to be included would have to be 'When the Saints go Marching In'. Another one of the most generally recognized songs by Louis Armstrong, it represents a more orchestral version of his music. This piece would also be played through small exhibits with headphones for listeners

## Objects

- The first object to be featured in the museum exhibit would have to be one of Armstrong's trumpets, the instrument he is most well known for. This would be displayed on a pedestal guarded by glass.

## Lighting and Room Description

The room of the museum would be a long hall. The lighting would be dim and the walls made of brick to mimic the smaller jazz clubs like the black and tan clubs seen in the Harlem Renaissance to give guests the feeling that they are in a place dedicated to jazz. In the background, speakers would quietly play West End Blues and then cycle to other songs of his, either with the Hot Five, Henderson's Orchestra, or others. spotlights from above would shine on the different sections of the exhibit, illuminating the objects, pictures, and listening stations at the start.
