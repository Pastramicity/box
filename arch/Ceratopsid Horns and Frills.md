# Ceratopsid Horns and Frills

Ceratopsids are some of the most recognizable dinosaurs we know today. With their large frills, ornamentation, and horns, they ask a serious yet simple evolutionary question: why are they there?

Initial thoughts may bring up scenes of fighting, where the large frills of a triceratops are used to protect against potential predators, however this does not seem to be the case. A large portion of ceratopsids had massive fenestra in their frills, providing little to no protection. Often when finding the origins of certain curious evolutionary features, a recurring theme comes up. Animals with large, biologically expensive features often use them to attract mates. The ornamentation and frills of ceratopsids especially were most likely used for this purpose. (Hone, 2018)

The purpose of the horns however, may have been twofold. They likely also contributed to sexual selection as mentioned above, however they may have served a different purpose. Rather than for use as a defense, the horns of ceratopsids may have been used to fight off attackers. (Yong, 2009)
