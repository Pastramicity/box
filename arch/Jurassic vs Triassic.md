# Triassic v. Jurassic

The ecology of the Triassic and Jurassic were similar in some ways and different in others. In contrast to the small basal carnivorous dinosaurs of the Triassic, the Jurassic dinosaurs started to diversify. Mammals existed for all of the Jurassic as opposed to them appearing only in the late Triassic. However, the flora of the Triassic and Jurassic were fairly similar. Dominated by conifers and the like.

In terms of evolution, the dinosaurs in particular were the main difference. The appearance of more herbivorous dinosaurs occurred with the likes of the sauropodomorphs. The saurischians and ornithischians really split off from one another.

In terms of physical state, the Earth was somewhat similar in basic appearance, however the separation of the continents was starting to occur.

The lessons we can take from this are that the Earth is ever evolving and ever differentiating. Some species may appear that seem to have little importance in the present, but may be of utmost importance in the future. The tectonic plates are ever-shifting, and the life on Earth will continue to flourish no matter what.
