# Infographic Memo

In creating this visual, I employed a few pieces of software. The first was Krita, used for creating the percentages of job stress and satisfaction within the outlines of people. The initial mockup draft for the infographic was made in KolourPaint, and the final product was assembled in Canva. I used Thunar and Obsidian for my file organization while creating the project and Obsidian was used as well to create this memo.

In creating this infographic, I had access to enough data that I would likely not have been able to fit it all into a single infographic without clutter everywhere. Because of this, I had to pick and choose which pieces of data to show without introducing my own bias into the equation. For this, I selected the top 5 recognizable big tech companies by early career median salary, excluding any that did not have all the information accounted for.

When assembling the infographic, I chose to focus on the experience of being a big tech employee and what that person would look like, choosing the statistics that would best fit that directive. For this I chose to include early career median salary, median age, percentage of people who said they were stressed at their job, and percentage of people who said they were satisfied with their job.

To display the data in a meaningful way that would allow for transparency and easy comparison, I chose to create a modified bar chart. The quantities of age and salary were displayed with opposing colors (green was chosen for money and a complement, orange, was chosen for age to contrast). For the percentages, I chose to fill an outline of the human body to represent the percentage height-wise. This would make it clear that there is a person, or set of people, being represented by this data, and it would let viewers relate to or personify the pure data. For the colors of these modified bar-chart elements, I similarly chose red for stress as I thought that would represent stress well, then chose blue as its complement for further contrast. I grouped all elements that were related by their respective company and labeled those with the company logo and name, grouped similar data points together within that, and labeled all data points with what they mean and their value. To use what Williams' taught, I refrained from using a separate key and put all the information related to data points in a place easily connected with those data points. I chose to include my name and date of creation, as well as a detailed source so better my ethos.

To enumerate Tufte's and Williams' principles and how I used them:
- Tufte
	- comparisons: I used the traditional bar chart to allow viewers to very easily compare the height of elements.
	- causality: I related the company someone may work at directly with the consequence of working there, salary, stress, and satisfaction in particular.
	- multivariate analysis: As explained before, Included were: company, age, salary, stress, and meaning.
	- integration of evidence: Everything is labeled as thoroughly as was possible within the space of the image.
	- documentation: included is a detailed citation of the source of the data, who created the visualization and when, and a succinct yet explanatory title.
	- content counts most of all: That's for the viewer to decide!
- Williams
	- contrast: Used are contrasting colors, ways to represent data, and different font sizes and boldness for emphasis
	- repetition: Each company is presented in a repeated way, with the same data points being represented the same way, but with different values. 
	- alignment: All throughout the picture is strong left and occasional right alignment. I avoided using center alignment as it is weaker, it was only used for the percentages, but there it makes sense within the symmetrical diagram of a person.
	- proximity: related data points are pushed together, and different ones are slightly separated. Title, source, keys, and every other set of elements is separated and distinct.
