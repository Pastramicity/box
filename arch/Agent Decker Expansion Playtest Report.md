# Agent Decker Expansion Playtest Report

Video link: https://youtu.be/MTj_Ka6JycI

## Current Goals

I want to find out which elements of my expansion need to be balanced, and to find out opportunities for new cards and mechanics to fix flaws I see with the base game, as well as enhance the game.

## Playtest Report

- Regular play with the default cards is still very viable, usually preferred
- Important cards to acquire early (keep cards in the expansion) often come up early and are discarded
- Some confusion around base game keep cards
- Flipping cards still happens, but still rare
- Confusion with handwriting on test cards
- Needed clarification on robot enhancement mechanic
- Needed clarification on side missions
- Needed clarification that robot and electricity cards are different
- Didn't come across many expansion cards
- Didn't interact with that many expansion cards that did appear
- Did complete the first mission on the last possible turn(often hard in the base game)
- Needed clarification on when to use side mission 1 ability
- Needed a lot of clarification on hacking device
- Had lots of equipment
- AI Stealth VR card nearly ended the game with its 10 alarm
- Lost the game from alarm after acquiring the guard uniform so late
- General slight confusion about added mechanics
- Often didn't have the resources to acquire added important cards
- Still encountered the problem in Agent Decker where some turns you simply can't do anything from lack of resources
- Bin card not used
- Often drew many fight cards while trying to get more hide, so few options to help the mission were available
- Often had few resources in total
- Needed clarification on what happens when you discard a starting hand card and put it into the obstacles draw pile
- Got likely further through the game than they would have without the expansion

## Future Goals

### Theories

- I need to write a set of rules on how the new cards work so that they don't need to be clarified
- I need more cards to make the expansion more impactful, including later into the mission obstacle cards (wasn't encountered in playtest but that is my theory) as expansion cards were interacted with few and far between
- I need to make cards cheaper and more impactful when played as again, they aren't played or disarmed much
- I need to make cards influence the line to add more player engagement.
- The symbolic difference between robotic card upgrades and robot type cards needs to be clearer (i.e. different symbols)
- More copies or similar cards to the powerful equipment cards like live wire and hacking device need to be added to fix the issue where they are discarded early due to lack of resources
- I may need to add more powerful starting hand cards as often times in the early game you can't interact with the line at all with the hand you are dealt
- Some new mechanic(s) need to be added to increase engagement, engagement seemed to be somewhat low, or what Agent Decker normally provides
- Not very often were cards knocked out (flipped), so more incentive for knocking out cards is important
- Cards that should force players to interact with them aren't impactful enough and can be ignored

### Next Iteration

In order to increase engagement, I plan to add a new reward system tied to knocking out cards. In order to make gameplay more risky and rewarding, I plan to add many more cards which emphasize planning and strategy, and that require a greater deal of focus and attention from the player.
