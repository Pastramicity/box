## Diversity

**Question**: 
What is your race and how do you know it?
**Response**:
Although race is an overbearing, over-referred-to term that should have little meaning as of nowadays, my race is 'white'. I know my genetic history and the overhwhelming majority of my ancestors hailed from Ireland, Sweden, England, Scotland, and small amounts from other North-Western European countries.

**Question**:
What is discrimination?
**Response**:
Discrimination is acting on a prejudice against a certain group in a negative way. Whether it be segregation, active malice towards a group such as lynching, laws against  them like the black codes, etc, or simply slighting a group in small ways, these are all forms of discrimination.
