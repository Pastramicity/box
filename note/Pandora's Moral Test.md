# Pandora's Moral Test

## The Test

There is an island separate from everything else. There are X hungry people and X muffins on that island. Y of those muffins are poisoned. Everyone will eat the muffins at once. You would be in this population. If someone eats a poisoned muffin, they die instantly and painlessly. If you eat a poisoned muffin, you die instantly and painlessly, however you will doom everyone on the island to die by poisoning. If you eat a muffin, it will be of the poisoned muffins.

With what X and Y are you comfortable? Your answer should be in the form "X, Y".

***WARNING, INFOHAZARD/MEMETIC HAZARD BELOW THIS POINT***

## Some Important Points

To even be considered for a moral/immoral status, you must know of the test or have been administered it properly.

Any immoral act/answer on this list that is committed or given by anyone immediately invalidates that person's moral acts/answers and makes them immoral (tough luck).

To ***void*** is to remove with no negative effects them and any who may be affected by the act of voiding.
