# CRAWLNT

**experimental note-taking system by pastramicity**

you have a single vault containing 6 folders

1. [[#card]]
2. [[#reso]]
3. [[#arch]]
4. [[#note]]
5. [[#work]]
6. [[#task]]
7. [[#lock]]

## card

**cards**

use this for making quick thought notes, these can be linked to other notes or integrated into your traditional [[#note|notes]]. recommended to use the zettelkasten method

## reso

**resources**

use this for resources like textbooks, images, etc. link to these in [[#note|notes]]

## arch

**archives**

use this for archives of things you don't care about anymore but don't want to delete. best used for finished [[#task|tasks]]

## note

**notes**

use this for organized, thoughtful notes

## work

**work**

use this for personal projects. same as todo but without a set due date. examples of work include poems/short stories/writing in general, markdown scrapbooking, outline/ideas for a youtube video, etc. things you don't *have* to do, but want to. things useful for hobbies.

## task

**tasks**

use this for assignments for school/work. title the files with# the date they are due. when completely done with a task, clear your workspace by putting the file in [[#arch|archives]]

## lock

**locked**

use this to store things you want password encrypted. do not store any of the password data in the vault, only you should know it.
