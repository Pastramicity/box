# Prehistoric
## Proterozoic

- terrestrial fungi first dominated the land (650mya)
- terrestrial animals were small arachnids and insects like silverfish (450mya)
	- arachnids (mite like)
	- insects
	- millipedes
- terrestrial plants
	- small, simple, no leaves
	- #Devonian plants
		- moss develops
		- large plants (**lycopods**)
		- trees w/o leaves
		- horsetails ^eb7d4c
			- some small
			- some trees
			- w/ leaves
		- ferns
			- same traits as [[#^eb7d4c|horsetails]]

### Leaving the water

- animals leaving the water start with 8 digits, go down to 5 over time
- no species on Earth have more than 5 digits now
- eyes and nose start on the top of the skull
- some amphibians like frogs got rid of their tails for mobility (jumping in frogs)

### Early mammals

- earliest mammals appear 350mya
- (synapsids) evolved from amniotes
- one opening behind the eye (lateral temporal fenestra)

### Diapsids

- supra and lateral temporal fenestra
- lizards, snakes, sea monsters
- mosasaurs
- ichthyosaurs (dolphin/shark-like)
- pliosaurs(no neck)
- plesiosaurs(w/ neck)

### Archosaurs

- Many look like dinosaurs but aren't
- crocodiles, alligators
- phytosaurs were like crocodiles but with nose holes on top
- Initially ruled the water before alligators/crocodiles

### Ornithidira

- Dinosaurs
- Pterosaurs
- Birds
- hinge-like ankles
- Dinosaurs, pterosaurs

#### Pterosaurs

- started and ended with dinosaurs
- tail and non-tail forms

## Mesozoic

### Ecology

#### Groups
- Ecosystems live in a *web*
- they don't generate waste, nearly everthing is recycled
- act as feedback loops
- every layer of an ecosystem has emergent properties; more than the sum of its parts

- Producers
	- Plants, some bacteria
	- provide primary source of energy in an ecosystem through #photosynthesis
- Primary Consumers
	- Herbivores
	- Insects
	- Many vertebrates
- Secondary Consumers
	- Carnivores
	- Eat herbivores
	- Sometimes omnivores
- Tertiary Consumers
	- decomposers
	- eat dead things

##### Pteridophytes

- ferns
- horsetails
- reproduce aquatically
- little in the way of defense
- live in wet environments

##### Gymnosperms

- conifers
- pine trees
- cypress
- ginkoes
- cycads
- release seeds
- more defense
	- thick bark
	- spines
	- thick walled cells
	- hard to digest
	- lots of resin

##### Angiosperms

- flowering plants
- release seeds protected in fruit
- appeared at the end of the Early #Cretacious
- protect their seeds
- world became much more vegetated after they developed
- recover quickly after cropping
- food for Late #Cretacious dinos

#### Co-evolution

##### Competition

- species evolve to compete, i.e. predator and prey evolving to live with eachother's presence

##### Cooperation

- other times species will learn to live with each other and even help eachother
- they will often become inseparable and form #symbiosis
- examples include humans and dogs, mitochondria, and sharks with the little dudes that eat the crap on their skin (i guess)


#### Plant-Animal Interactions

- most organisms depend on plants
- plants determine environment/biome
- plants and animals [[#Co-evolution|co-evolve]]
- digestibility is important to animals (cows have like 4 stomachs!)
- the larger the animal, the lower quality and higher quantity of food they eat
- larger animals use **microbial fermentation** requireing bigger stomachs and more big intestines
- This leads to the development of **whole-plant predators** who eat large parts of a plant, often hurting/killing it rather than eating smaller more select parts as smaller animals can


### Dinosaurs
