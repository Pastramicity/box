## How to Improve

- market research
- think logically about problems
- do independent research
- In order to get better at design, we can't just think about design, but create and iterate
- Practice makes perfect
- Don't just rely on novel ideas, but also incorporate proven methods and make sure your ideas actually function in the way you intend
- focus on the human experience with you solution
- use the perspective of others, don't just rely on your intuition in design
- ask why various design choices around you are made

## Writing Better Notes

- all caps
- make confident lines
- keep writing flat and consistent, legible
- write in full, complete sentences, not quick bullets
	- i.e. 'We need to teach more divergent thinking in schools' vs 'Divergent thinking schools'
- mindmap in landscape
- Keep one central idea in word clusters
