# Design

## Artifacts

## How to Improve

- market research
- think logically about problems
- do independent research
- In order to get better at design, we can't just think about design, but create and iterate
- Practice makes perfect
- Don't just rely on novel ideas, but also incorporate proven methods and make sure your ideas actually function in the way you intend
- focus on the human experience with you solution
- use the perspective of others, don't just rely on your intuition in design
- ask why various design choices around you are made

## Writing Better Notes

- all caps
- make confident lines
- keep writing flat and consistent, legible
- write in full, complete sentences, not quick bullets
	- i.e. 'We need to teach more divergent thinking in schools' vs 'Divergent thinking schools'
- mindmap in landscape
- Keep one central idea in word clusters
- when in doubt, simplify

## Framing

- Exploring & understanding a problem space by zooming out (and in) to change focus
- goals
	- see the big picture
	- define a project's scope
	- articulate a problem statement

### Steps

- everything starts with a 'pain point' or observable problem
- the problem space is explored
	- Why did this happen?
	- When did this occur?
	- etc...
	- Think about systems, not individual pieces
	- Approaches
		- Reductionist
			- break a complex system into parts and examine them on their own
			- generates truth and rules
		- System
			- Examine a whole system to see patterns
			- generates a spectrum
- A problem statement is articulated
	- a goal
	- To (do something for someone)
	- So they can (experience an improvement)

### Definitions

- Systems Thinking
	- Everything is interconnected
	- every action causes a reaction
	- every system has discrete parts
	- every system has an input & output
	- can be simple or complex
- System levels
	- micro
		- emotion and thought
	- personal
		- objects and tools
	- social
		- people that affect a situation
	- environmental
		- where this occurs
	- macro
		- large structures and laws that shape events

## UN Goal: Energy Sustainability

### Questions for Users

- How do you use electricity on a daily basis?
- Does your power grid support this use?
- How often are you without electricity?
- Do outages cause difficulty for you?
- Do you supply your own energy?
- Does your place of work rely on electricity?
- Do outages cause issues at work?
- What source of energy do you rely on?
- Does the environmental impact of energy production affect you and how?
