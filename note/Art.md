# Art
## Perspective/Scale

- To understand or imply the size of an object, use familiar objects in reference
- putting details and familiar objects/patterns on large objects, you can get a sense of scale

## Lines

- Building block of visuals
- relation between edges (smooth, rough, irregular, etc.)
- consistent irregularities: hand-drawn organic feel
- inconsistent irregularity: creepy
- actual or implied lines
- implied lines are in contrast between shapes or colors
- can be used for shading/texture
- hatching, cross-hatching for shading
- can be used to give a sense of motion (motion lines)
- organize information
- orientation against gravity is important
- horizontal lines give a large, lumbering feel
- vertical lines give an impression of activeness, imposing feeling
- diagonal lines make characters look agile
- lines meeting at hard angles gives an impression of rigidity
- lines meeting at soft angles gives a soft impression

### Outlines

- outline: line that bounds a shape
- outlines emphasize a high contrast boundary between shapes, makes shapes look important
- outlines can be used to emphasize mechanically important game objects
- outlines make things cartoony

### Contour Lines

- used in contour maps (shows change in height)
- associated w/ comics

## Color

- Different color profiles
	- light: RGBa (Red Green Blue alpha)
	- print: CMYK (Cyan Magenta Yellow Black)
- Saturation: amount of *chroma* in a color
- More saturation, more cartoony
- More neutral, more natural
- Value: measure of color brightness
- Colors made by adding white are called *tints*
- Colors made by adding black are called *shades*
- Tonal key: average brightness.
	- High tonal key is cartoony
	- Dark tonal key is ominous
- Tonal range: distance between darkest darks and whitest whites (contrast)
	- Wider tonal range is dynamic
	- Thinner tonal range is subdued, calm

### Hue

- '*color*'
- can influence the emotion of an image
- red appears *on top* of other colors (chromostereopsis)

- yellow is the next best attention-getter
- yellow is 'powerful'
- green associated with nature
- green is also *decay*
- blue represents anything cerebral/intellectual
- blue often used for magic
- blue is used for sci-fi *magic*
- blue is subdued, creates feelings of isolation, depression
- purple is mysterious as it's not seen in nature
- purple is 'otherworldly'
- purple is playful
- hue is the most critical aspect to creating emotion/visual language in a game

## Identifiers/Signifiers

### Identifiers

- color is used to identify certain game objects in your game
- separated from the rest of the colors in your game

*Green for loot in Borderlands*

### Signifiers
- Comprised of more specific things
- Examples include signs, labels, symbols, etc.
- Commonly used, but seeing one for the first time shouldn't confuse someone (with good design of course)


## Texture

- Texture is the quality of a material in an image.
- texture can be implied
- *Simulated* textures are textures you have an intuit understanding of how they feel to touch
- *Invented* textures are patterns and textures that don't have an inherit sense of touch
- textures in games have rough-smooth for how consistently light is reflected.
- textures also have mat-shiny for how much light is reflected back.
- consistency/regularity of a texture gives a comforting feeling
- inconsistency is uncomfortable

## Pattern

- repetition of artistic motifs
- patterns have **Rhythm**
- **regular rhythm**: one element repeated over and over
- **alternating rhythm**: alternating motifs repeated in a pattern

*alternating rhythm in Stardew Valley*

- **progressive rhythm** patterns that change over time/distance

### Seamless Textures

- Lines should match up on either side of tiles, vertically and horizontally
- employ [[Art#Wabi-Sabi|Wabi Sabi]]
- use principles of [[Art#Texture|textures]]

## Wabi-Sabi

- Wabi: Slight natural imperfections make textures look good (i.e. wonder bread vs artisanal bread)
- Sabi: Aging makes textures look more natural as well


## Typography

- point size
	- size of the text
	- desktop publishing point
	- 1/72nd of an inch on a printed page
	- measures with *em square*
		- dist from highest highs in font to lowest lows
- line  
	- how long the text goes until a new line
	- shorter line lengths is more digestible
	- made for quick info like shopping list, newspaper article
	- longer line lengths useful for things with lots of important information like a book
- leading/spacing
	- vertical space between lines of text
	- based on em square
	- 120%-145% leading is optimal for reading
	- ascenders
		- tops of your very highest letters
	- cap height
		- height of standard capital letters (usually the same as the ascender)
	- baseline
		- bottom of standard letters
	- x-height
		- from the baseline to the lowest ascender/cap height. (height of 'x')
	- descenders
		- bottom of letters that go below baseline (gyj, etc.)
	- fonts with high ascenders and low descenders should not be used on multi-line text
- tracking/letter spacing
	- distance between two letters
	- dependent on the typeface
	- messing with the leading can make text look interesting but less readable
	- kerning
		- per letter combination spacing adjustments
		- 
- typeface
	- entire font family like arial, times new roman, etc.
	- font
		- specific set in a typeface (bold, light, regular, etc.)
	- serif (w/ accents)
		- adds legibility
		- more formal, historical, etc.
	- sans-serif (w/o accents)
		- more legible on smaller, low resolution screens
		- more modern, scientific themes
	- proportion/monospace 
		- letters with respective proportions are more legible
		- monospace fonts have the same letter width across all letters
		- monospace fonts are made for programming, accounting, stat screens, etc.


## Raster vs. Vector

- Raster graphics are working with pixels
- Vector graphics are working with lines, shapes, and equations
- photoshop is raster
- illustrator is vector
- vector graphics scale
- raster graphics lose information when scaled down, pixelly when scaled up
- printing industry uses vector graphics (for big posters for example)

## Apps

### Photoshop

#### File Creation
- When creating a new image, you can use the clipboard to match copied image size
- make sure images are larger resolution

#### Masking Tool

- selectively applies transparency
- alternative to magic wand/color selector
- black is transparent, white is opaque
- select object (with magic wand for example), hit mask button in bottom right
- used to save information rather than delete it
-  editing object will not interfere with background (acts as having active selection)
- you can directly edit the mask on the layer
- to remove mask, right click -> delete
- inverse selection: Ctrl+Shift+I
- right click -> apply to apply mask and make it a single image again
- magic wand good for cleaning masks
- quick selection tool to quickly expand or retract selection

#### Clone Stamp Tool

- Useful for extending textures in a seamless way



### Illustrator

- illustrator uses objects more than layers
- large workspace
- up/down arrow increases sides on polygon tool
	- same for star tool
- ctrl key to increase star point size on star tool
- pen tool lets you make custom polygons, holding left click makes bezier curve
- gradient tool replaces paint bucket
- pathfinder combines objects in different ways (joining, subtracting, merging, etc.)

### Maya

- different workspaces (top right)
- File -> send to Unity/Unreal (*probably useful*)
- Modify -> transform options
- Display -> Heads Up Display -> Poly count
- Windows -> Preferences -> Undo -> Queue size should be larger (200-500 recommended)
- left side
	- select: q
	- lasso
	- knife?
	- rotate: e
	- scale: r
	- insert edge loop
	- switch between camera views, hit space bar on window
	- toggle outliner (list of objects)
	- focus on selected object: f
	- change names of objects in outliner
- double click on Poly Modeling -> shape brings up new shape settings
- world, object symmetry
- change pivot: hold d
- Modify -> center pivot
- boolean
	- union: combine
	- difference: subtracts/removes
- you shouldn't have any faces with more than 4 sides
- hold right mouse -> change selection mode
- combine objects physically with bridge tool
	- select edges on hole (shift double click?) and bridge
- Mesh -> cleanup (box), highlight or fix
- Modify -> Freeze transformation applies transforms
- Delete history before exporting because Maya explodes?


### Zbrush
